## What is it?
***Hero’s Insight*** is a mod for the game ***Guild Wars*** focused on improving buildcrafting and gameplay through helpful ingame tools and statistics.

The mod is named after the Guild Wars item [*Hero's Insight*](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Hero%27s_Insight), which grants the player's character double experience while active. In the same spirit, the mod aims to do the same, but for the actual player this time 😁.

## How to install
Download the lastest release [link to latest release]. Unzip it to wherever you want to install the mod. Done. Now you can launch the mod by running the exe.

## What it does
The following features available today.

### Skillbook
The skill book is a powerful tool for buildcrafters, or when you just want to find that one skill to equip. It allows filtering and sorting of all skills in the game.

For example it could be used to:
* Find all stance skills
* Find all skills giving health regen
* Find all skills related to knock-down
* Find all skills giving +damage and sort by amount

Or even, if you've completely lost your mind:
* Find all hexes, in prophecies or nightfall, yet to be unlocked, having a recharge of 10 seconds or less. Sort by energy cost, then by AoE range.

## FAQ
- ### Help! My antivirus software is flagging ***Hero’s Insight*** as Malware. Have I been infected?
  If you have downloaded the mod from this Github repository: No you have not been infected. You can safely add **Launch_HerosInsight.exe** to you antivirus software's whitelist/exlusion list and keep using the mod.

  Explanation: Antivirus software uses a bunch of heuristics to determine if something is malware or not. Sometimes these heuristics fail and you get false positives. In the case of ***Hero’s Insight***, the antivirus software maybe saw that its a lesser known exe, maybe few users etc. Maybe it checked the code and saw that it uses dll injection, a method also used by malware sometimes, however in this case for a completely benign purpose.

## Contributions
You are very welcome to report bugs by opening issues and provide feedback and/or feature requests using discussions here in Github.

However, contributing to ***Hero’s Insight*** is currently hard because it is dependent on a closed source fork of GWCA. You cannot build the project it without it.

(Author note: As I understand it, GWCA was made private to prevent misuse (botting, cheating, etc.), so for that reason I have decided not to publish my fork of it either. We'll see how this changes in the future.)
